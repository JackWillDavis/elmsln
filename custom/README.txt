ELMSLN Config

This is where all of your configuration that makes this deployment specific to your server should live.  This will contain all modules, themes, libraries, and install profiles you want to add to your Drupal sites.

Explanation of the directories
profiles - any profiles outside of the included ones you want (this is experimental)
scripts - add in script hook files here for installation/upgrade routines
shared - all the additional modules, themes, settings, and libraries you want to include
webcomponents - add any custom webcomponents into this folder to be loaded across the network
